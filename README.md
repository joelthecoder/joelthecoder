Hello,

My name is Joel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high-energy Dev Manager with a passion for elevating teams to reach their full potential. Iâ€™m deeply committed to best practices, creating maintainable, thoroughly tested code. My approach blends technical expertise with a strong focus on personal growth and mentorship.

Throughout my [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joellanglois), Iâ€™ve honed skills in:

- React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and MySQL & PostgreSQL
- Container orchestration and server management
- Technical planning
- Developer mentoring
- Change management
- Project management and documentation
- Technical and security assessments

Recently, I decided to take a break from my career to fully immerse myself in the beauty of life. I traveled to breathtaking destinations, enjoyed incredible food, danced to the music I love, and built meaningful relationships. This time away allowed me to ground myself, expand my perspective, and focus on personal growth.

âœ¨âœ¨ Now, feeling rejuvenated and more energized than ever, Iâ€™m ready to return and make an even greater impact. Iâ€™m excited about the future and eager to connect with others who share my passion for building strong teams and delivering high-quality products.

Letâ€™s connect and chat!
